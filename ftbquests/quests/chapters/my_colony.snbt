				"Unlike the normal villagers you might see in the world, your colonists are a bit smarter. They’ll generally find a pretty good path to get where they want to go due to their advanced degrees in walking from Raycoms University and their RavenEyes© vision."
				""
				"As such, they’re able to move across flat ground, single-block steps, stairs, slabs, and other such blocks. They know how to open both wood and iron doors — even without any redstone input — trapdoors, and fence gates. They’ll climb up and down ladders and vines just fine as well. However, they will try to avoid going through fences, as is expected, and generally will find a way around dangerous obstacles like fire, magma, lava, cacti, and sweet berry bushes."
				""
				"- Getting Stuck"
				"But what if a colonist can’t find a path to where they want to go? What if, say, they fall in a hole and get stuck, or they’re trying to climb somewhere high up that doesn’t have any way there yet, or if they get trapped inside a wall by an overenthusiastic Builder? Not to fear! Your colonists are also slightly magical in that, if they’re stuck in one place for too long, they’ll build up enough willpower to relocate themselves forcibly to a nearby valid location and continue on their way."
				""
				"- Waypoints and Decorative Paths"
				"Waypoints are also used to guide your citizens along the right path, but whereas the pathblocks are for local pathing, waypoints are used more for long-distance pathing. Adding a waypoint onto bridges, for example, or in areas that you want citizens to traverse a little more frequently, can help them path across the colony more easily. As such, you don’t need very many waypoints: having a couple here and there where the pathing may be more difficult is plenty."
				""
				"The Builder can build waypoints if you request them with the build tool. You can find them in the under the decorative elements of the build tool."
				""
				"To remove a waypoint, place a solid block, such as dirt, on the waypoint and wait a few minutes. After a while, you can remove the block, and the waypoint should be removed."
				""
				"The build tool also includes several decorative paths as part of the schematics. These paths often include waypoints, so you can see how the professional schematics designers used them."

				""

There will be a chat message giving a general direction of where the raid spawned and a bar at the top of your screen showing your progress in defeating the raiders. Raids spawn randomly, with a minimum number of nights between them and an average number of nights as set in the config file. Larger colonies may get multiple waves or groups of raiders from different directions, even of different types. Be careful!"
				""

				"- During the Raid"
				"Raiders will run around the colony breaking down doors and trying to attack your Guards and colonists. Generally, raiders will path toward hut blocks in your colony, similar to what Guards do on patrol.Trying to “cheese” the raiders usually will not work. They are able to path fairly well, though if they are unable to find any path to their destination, they will break through any block, place ladders to climb up obstacles, or place blocks to bridge gaps to get to your colony. They can swim straight through moving water and lava, taking no damage from lava. Any attack that hits a raider too hard will be reflected back at the attacker. Similarly, turrets (from other mods) generally will not be effective on raiders.Raiders have a chance to drop their equipment when you or your Guards defeat them. They may also drop Ancient Tomes, which are used in enchanting."
				""
				"- After the Raid"
				"After all of the raiders have been defeated and spawners broken, your colonists will go back to their jobs. If any of your colonists die, then their family will mourn their death and not work that day. However, Guards will not be mourned."
